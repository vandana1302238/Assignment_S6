## Part 2 - Modifying the given network

For the mnist dataset and the respective architecture given as example, the task is to modify the architecture in such a way that
- 99.4% validation accuray is reached
- less than 20k parameters
- less than 20 epochs
- making use of batch normalization, dropout
- fully connected layer(optional)
- using GAP

Thus, using the above cretiaria mentioned, the code implementation is attached herewith.

## Results
With the given creteria, I've tried to acheive validation accuracy to 99.2%
The modifications have been done in number of layers, type of layers and batch size.
